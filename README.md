``excalibur``: an unsupervised leader-finding process
====================================================

Camelot is a big place with a lot of problems, but there's one we care about. *In this first paragraph, you must explain what that problem is.* Our problem is that Camelot needs a leader.

Camelot needs a solution, and ``excalibur`` is the *(clever -- maybe even cheeky)* name of the one thing that solves this one problem best. *It sounds almost magical in how it could simply solve the problems above - problems that many people have tried to solve before. Now, you explain how it solves those problems:* ``excalibur`` tells you instantly whether or not a person is that leader.

*In this final introductory paragraph, you explain how* ``excalibur`` works differently than most other attempted solutions. Specifically, it's hard to pull out of a stone, so only real leaders can do it.

Installation
------------

    $ pip install excalibur

When in doubt, make installation a single line.

Usage
-----

``excalibur`` consists of a single function*, but your magical and awesome package may consist of more. Here's where you briefly describe what each function does.* ``can_become_king`` accepts a single Django user, and returns a bool. *What's more, this method makes sense: it tells you what it'll return, and it tells you what it needs. It doesn't matter that ``excalibur`` is a sword. What the sword does matters far more.*

    excalibur = Excalibur()
    arthur = User.objects.get(first_name="Arthur")
    excalibur.can_become_king(arthur)
    > True

Try not to:
-----------
* be too technical. Focus on the pain of the users.
* be too brief. You need to do more than tell people how to use it. You have to tell them why they should.
* be too broad. It would be great if everyone used your open source project. But it's better to focus on a clear, small case where this solution is the best. First, find people who care more than anyone else. Second, make them care even more.
